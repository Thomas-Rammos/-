# Diploma Thesis

In this thesis, we study three distinct scheduling problems and implement three corresponding algorithms, each with different specifications and objectives. Initially, we focus on the problem of executing tasks on exactly three dedicated machines and propose a linear-time approximation algorithm that guarantees an approximation ratio of 7/6 compared to the optimal makespan. Subsequently, we examine a more general version of the problem, where the number of machines is greater, and we implement the Longest First (LF) algorithm. LF runs in O(dmlog n) time and ensures a constant approximation ratio, which, in the most general case, does not exceed four times the optimal, with improvements in specific classes of graphs. Finally, we address an entirely different problem that aims to minimize the number of calibrations. For this problem, we implement the Preemptive Lazy Binning (PLB) algorithm, which solves the problem exactly in polynomial time (O(nÂ²)) without being an approximation method. We present the complexity and theoretical properties of each algorithm and additionally conduct an extensive experimental study on various datasets. Our results confirm that the first two algorithms provide approximate solutions with provably low deviation from the optimal, while the third algorithm precisely solves the calibration problem, validating the theoretical predictions.
